# **scrambled**

**scrambled** is an anagram word game in which the player attempts to solve as many anagrams as they can. The player can choose a 5-, 6-, or 7-letter word game. The player has three lives; they lose a life if they make an incorrect guess or opt to reveal the word. A correct guess allows them to proceed to the next word. The game ends when the three lives are up or when the player decides. The player is then given a summary of the game and an invitation to start a new game.

# 1. User Experience UX

## Strategy

The aim is to provide a fun game in the style of Countdown's Conundrum round, in which players attempt to solve an anagram. The game is intended to be light-hearted and user-friendly, but also be informative and present a degree of challenge. Players will be able to play a casual game, and dedicated wordgame enthusiasts will be able to play multiple times to hone their anagram-solving skills. 

In the conundrum round, players are given 30-seconds to solve a 9-letter anagram; the aim is for the player to guess the anagram before their opponent. In **scrambled** the aim is for the user to solve as many anagrams as they can, so the timer element is replaced with a system of lives. This allows the user more thinking time and makes the game more open-ended: players could potentially play indefinitely, as long as they keep correctly guessing the anagrams. The limited number of lives keeps a degree of challenge - players must be careful with their guesses.

The conundrum round exclusively features 9-letter anagrams. To make **scrambled** accessible to a wide range of users, the user will be able to select the length of anagram they want to solve, either 5-, 6-, or 7-letter words. There will also be the option to shuffle the order of the letters to provide a fresh perspective on the anagram. The player can to do this as many times as they like.

In Countdown, the 'Dictionary Corner' feature gives information about discovered words. **scrambled** will also feature a short definition of words, once they have been unscrambled or revealed. This adds an informative/educational aspect to the game; users can develop their vocabulary while playing the game.

## User stories

As a player of the game, I want:
1. To find out how to play the game
2. To navigate easily around the game
3. To have clear feedback on my guesses
4. To clearly see how many lives I have remaining
5. To be able to shuffle the letters of the anagram
6. To be able to end the game at any stage
7. To have helpful feedback on my guesses
8. To be protected from accidentally ending the game by clicking on links or the end game button
9. To receive a summary of each game
10. To have a running total of the words I have solved
11. To know more about each unscrambled word

## Site Structure

The site is structured in one page with three iterations:

[*Home*](index.html)
- The landing page contains the title, a brief description, links to instructions and information about the game, and a button to start a new game.

[*Gameplay*](gameplay.html)
- The main gameplay page
- displays when users click on 'new game' button on home page
- Displays the anagram
- user interaction panel - guess input, buttons for shuffle, reveal/next word and end game
- feedback panel - displays messages to user, including information about unscrambled words

[*Game over*](game-over.html)
- Displays a summary of the game just played
- navigated to once user confirms end game, or the last life is lost
- contains the new game button which navigates back to the gameplay page

## Wireframes

The following wireframes were created in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) and include responsive design ideas for Laptop, Tablet and Mobile devices. 

**Home page**

## Design choices

**Typography**

Gabarito font, from Google Fonts, is used throughout. It's a fun, bold font which gives a lighthearted feel, and it also scales well to display the main anagram in capitals. The font defaults to sans serif.

**Icons**

Heart icons from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) are used to show the number of lives remaining (solid and outlines).

**Colours**

The colour scheme was chosen to give a high contrast and clean effect with splashes of colour for icons and buttons.

![Colour palette](/assets/readme-images/palette.png)

**Styling**

- The aim is to make the page as intuitive to use as possible, and to keep the main gameplay buttons and features clearly organised. On tablet and laptop viewports, user input features will be kept on the left of the screen and feedback will be on the right. On mobile devices, the user input and buttons will be just below the displayed word, and feedback below.

## 2. Features

The site is intended to be easy to navigate around and intuitive to use. Common layout, terminology and icons are used to help the user find their way around easily, and high contrast between font and background has been used to make the text immediately clear.
